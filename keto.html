            <h1>KETO DIET</h1>

    <div class="info" style="color: white;">
        The ketogenic (keto) diet is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat dietary regimen that triggers a metabolic state known
        as ketosis. Characterized by a drastic reduction in carbohydrate intake and an increase in healthy fats, the
        diet shifts the body's primary energy source from glucose to ketones. This metabolic shift is believed to offer
        various health benefits, including weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced mental clarity.

        Key principles of the keto diet involve limiting carb intake to around 20-50 grams per day, encouraging a higher
        consumption of fats (approximately 70-75% of total daily calories), and maintaining a moderate protein intake.
        By depriving the body of its usual glucose supply derived from carbs, it prompts the liver to produce ketones
        from stored fat, which are then utilized as an alternative energy source.

        Foods commonly embraced on the keto diet include meat, fish, eggs, dairy, nuts, seeds, and low-carb vegetables,
        while sugars, grains, and most fruits are restricted. The diet has gained popularity not only for weight loss
        but also for potential therapeutic applications, such as managing epilepsy and improving certain metabolic
        conditions.

        While research suggests positive outcomes for some individuals, it's crucial to note that the keto diet may not
        be suitable for everyone, and potential side effects, such as nutrient deficiencies, should be considered.
        Consulting with a healthcare professional before embarking on the keto journey is advisable, especially for
        those with underlying health conditions. In summary, the keto diet offers a unique approach to nutrition,
        emphasizing fat metabolism and ketone production, but careful consideration and personalized guidance are
        essential for its successful and sustainable implementation.
