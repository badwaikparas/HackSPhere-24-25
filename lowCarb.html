        A low-carbohydrate (low-carb) diet is an eating plan that restricts the intake of carbohydrates, typically
        focusing on consuming fewer sugars and starches. The primary goal is to control blood sugar levels and promote
        weight loss by reducing the body's reliance on glucose for energy. Common features include higher consumption of
        protein and healthy fats.

        Low-carb diets vary in their carbohydrate limits, but they generally emphasize foods like meat, fish, eggs,
        nuts, seeds, non-starchy vegetables, and healthy fats, while limiting or avoiding sugars, grains, and high-carb
        processed foods.

        Benefits may include improved weight management, stabilized blood sugar levels, and enhanced cardiovascular
        health. However, individual responses can vary, and potential drawbacks may include nutrient deficiencies if not
        well-balanced. Consulting with a healthcare professional is recommended before starting a low-carb diet,
        especially for individuals with specific health concerns.
