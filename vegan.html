        Healthy eating as a vegan
        You can get the nutrients you need from eating a varied and balanced vegan diet including fortified foods and
        supplements.

        For a healthy vegan diet:

        eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day
        base meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates (choose wholegrain where possible)
        have some fortified dairy alternatives, such as soya drinks and yoghurts (choose lower-fat and lower-sugar
        options)
        eat some beans, pulses and other proteins
        eat nuts and seeds rich in omega-3 fatty acids (such as walnuts) every day
        choose unsaturated oils and spreads, and eat in small amounts
        have fortified foods or supplements containing nutrients that are more difficult to get through a vegan diet,
        including vitamin D, vitamin B12, iodine, selenium, calcium and iron
        drink plenty of fluids (the government recommends 6 to 8 cups or glasses a day)
        If you choose to include foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt or sugar, have them less often and in small
        amounts.

        See The Eatwell Guide for more information about a healthy diet.

        The Eatwell Guide applies to vegetarians, vegans, people of all ethnic origins and those who are a healthy
        weight for their height, as well as those who are overweight.

        The only group The Eatwell Guide is not suitable for is children under the age of 2, as they have different
        needs.

        Getting the right nutrients from a vegan diet
        With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the
        nutrients your body needs.

        If you do not plan your diet properly, you could miss out on essential nutrients, such as calcium, iron, vitamin
        B12, iodine and selenium.
