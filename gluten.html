        A gluten-free diet involves avoiding foods that contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their
        derivatives. This diet is essential for individuals with celiac disease, a serious autoimmune disorder triggered
        by gluten ingestion, causing damage to the small intestine.

        Gluten sensitivity or wheat allergy can also prompt individuals to adopt a gluten-free lifestyle. Common
        gluten-free foods include fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and gluten-free grains like rice and
        quinoa. Gluten-free alternatives, such as rice flour or almond flour, replace traditional wheat-based products.

        While crucial for those with gluten-related disorders, a gluten-free diet may lack certain nutrients, so careful
        planning is necessary. It has gained popularity beyond medical necessity, with some people attributing benefits
        like improved digestion and increased energy to gluten avoidance. However, there's limited scientific evidence
        supporting these claims for individuals without gluten-related disorders. Consulting with a healthcare
        professional or a registered dietitian is advisable before adopting a gluten-free diet.
